    "I might be 28, but honestly, Iâ€™m still 16 at heartâ€”especially when it comes to my mood swings. One minute Iâ€™m fine, the next Iâ€™m overthinking whether my flight is going to get hijacked on my way home... again.",
    "Oh, and if you mention cockroaches in my presence, just know Iâ€™ll go full-on ninja mode to eliminate them. Iâ€™m also addicted to compliments, so feel free to tell me how amazing I am at any given moment (you wonâ€™t be wrong). I might get anxious over the smallest things, but hey, Iâ€™m hot, so thatâ€™s my one free pass in life. ðŸ˜Ž"
